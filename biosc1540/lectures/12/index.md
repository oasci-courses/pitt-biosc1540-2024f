# Lecture 12

**Date:** Oct 3, 2024

This lecture will serve as a comprehensive review of the module, using a case study to illustrate how the various concepts and techniques covered are applied in real-world research.
It will help students connect the dots between different topics and prepare them for applying their knowledge in the exam and beyond.
The case study approach will also help demonstrate the practical relevance of the material, reinforcing its importance for both computational biology majors and biology majors.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Synthesize key concepts from genomics and transcriptomics covered in the module, including sequencing technologies, genome assembly, and RNA-seq analysis.
2.  Apply their understanding of bioinformatics workflows to a real-world research scenario presented as a case study.
3.  Analyze and interpret example datasets that integrate genomic and transcriptomic information.
4.  Critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of different bioinformatics approaches in addressing specific biological questions.
5.  Propose appropriate analytical strategies for novel research questions involving genomics and transcriptomics data.
6.  Discuss the broader implications of bioinformatics analyses in advancing biological understanding and potential applications.
