## Catalog description

This course gives students a broad understanding of how computational approaches can solve problems in biology.
We will also explore the biological and computational underpinnings of the methods.

!!! note

    The [catalog course description](https://catalog.upp.pitt.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?coid=1135443&catoid=213) mandates what material this course has to cover.
    How the material is covered is at the discretion of the instructor.

## Prerequisites

To enroll, you must have received a minimum grade of `C` in Foundations of Biology 2 (BIOSC 0160, 0165, or 0716).

!!! warning "Programming experience"

    Exposure to programming language fundamentals such as variables, functions, and conditionals is not required but **strongly recommended**.
    We will be using Python&mdash;especially [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)/[Polars](https://pola.rs/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)&mdash;throughout the course to explore topics in computational biology.
    The [teaching team](/team) will provide a crash course in Python during the first week of class and use an ungraded skills check to assess your programming preparedness.
