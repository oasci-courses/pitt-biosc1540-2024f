# Programming+ recitations

Welcome to the Programming+ recitations for our Computational Biology course!

| Day | Time | Location |
| --- | ---- | -------- |
| Friday | 2:00 - 3:30 pm | 315 Clapp Hall |

## What are Programming+ Problems?

Programming+ problems are optional, advanced coding challenges designed to:

1.  Deepen your understanding of computational biology concepts
2.  Enhance your programming skills
3.  Provide hands-on experience with real-world bioinformatics scenarios

These problems are not required for course completion but offer valuable additional learning opportunities.

## Recitation Format

These sessions are not lectures.
Instead, they provide a dedicated time and space for you to:

-   Ask questions about Programming+ problems
-   Seek guidance on approach and implementation
-   Discuss challenges and potential solutions
-   Collaborate with other like-minded students

The instructor will be available to provide support, clarification, and direction as needed.

## What to Bring

-   Your laptop
-   Any code you're working on
-   Specific questions or issues you'd like to address

## Guidelines

1.  **Come prepared:** Review the problem and attempt a solution before the recitation.
2.  **Be specific:** The more precise your questions, the more effectively we can assist you.
3.  **Collaborate:** Feel free to discuss approaches with your peers during the session.
4.  **Respect others:** Keep conversations at a reasonable volume.

We look forward to seeing you at the recitations and supporting your journey in computational biology!
