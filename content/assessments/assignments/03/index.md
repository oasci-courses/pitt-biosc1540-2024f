**b)** Compare and contrast the challenges of identifying genes in GC-rich vs. AT-rich prokaryotic genomes.

## Q09

In gene prediction, coding scores are often used to identify potential protein-coding regions.
One method to calculate coding scores involves analyzing the frequency of hexamers (6-nucleotide sequences) in known genes versus the entire genome.
Given the following information:

-   Hexamer: `ATGGCC`
-   Frequency in known genes ($G$): 0.015
-   Frequency in the whole genome ($B$): 0.005

**a)** Calculate the coding score $C(w)$ for this hexamer using the formula:

$$
C(w) = \log \left(\frac{G(w)}{B(w)} \right)
$$

Where $G(w)$ is the frequency of the word in genes, and $B(w)$ is the frequency in the whole genome.

**b)** Interpret the result.
What does the score indicate about this hexamer?

**c)** If you found this hexamer in an uncharacterized region of DNA, how might this score influence your assessment of whether this region is likely to be protein-coding?

## Q10

You are analyzing a short DNA sequence to determine if there is likely to be a protein-coding gene.

-   Given DNA sequence: `ATATGCATGCTTAGCTTA`

You have a table of pre-calculated coding scores for all possible hexamers based on known genes in the bacteria's genome.

| Hexamer | Score | Hexamer | Score |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| ATATGC  | -0.2  | CATGCT  | 1.2   |
| TATGCA  | -0.4  | ATGCTT  | 0.7   |
| ATGCAT  | 0.8   | TGCTTA  | -0.1  |
| TGCATG  | -0.2  | GCTTAG  | 0.3   |
| GCATGC  | 0.5   | CTTAGC  | 0.6   |
| TTAGCT  | -0.3  | TAGCTT  | -0.5  |
| AGCTTA  | 0.1   |         |       |

**a)** Calculate the overall coding score for the **gene** in this DNA sequence.
To do this:

-   Determine the score for each overlapping hexamer in the gene.
-   Sum these scores to get the total coding score for the gene.

Remember that you [shift over one codon a time](https://slides.com/aalexmmaldonado/biosc1540-l05#/4/6).
(I had to [read their C code](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal/blob/c1e2d361479cc1b18175ea79ebd8ff10411c46cb/node.c#L325-L367) to figure this out.)

**b)** What is the average coding score per hexamer for this sequence?

**c)** Based on your results, do you think this gene is likely to be protein-coding?
Explain your reasoning.

**d)** Discuss potential limitations of using this hexamer-based coding score approach for gene prediction.
What factors might lead to false positives or false negatives?

## Programming+

These problems are not required and will not impact your BIOSC 1540 grade.
The instructor will assess these separately to validate correctness without an assigned grade.
Thus, you may work on these problems individually or in a team-based setting and "due" by the end of the semester.
Happy coding!

Use the following function to compute the hexamer scores.

```python
def compute_hexamer_score(hexamer):
    """
    Compute a score for a given hexamer based on its nucleotide composition.

    This function uses a simple scoring system based on GC content and specific dinucleotide frequencies.

    Args:
        hexamer (str): A string of 6 nucleotides (A, T, C, or G)

    Returns:
        The computed score for the hexamer
    """
    if len(hexamer) != 6 or not all(base in 'ATCG' for base in hexamer.upper()):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a string of 6 nucleotides (A, T, C, or G)")

    hexamer = hexamer.upper()

    # Base scores
    base_scores = {'A': 1, 'T': 1, 'C': 2, 'G': 2}

    # Dinucleotide bonus scores
    dinucleotide_bonus = {'CG': 0.5, 'GC': 0.5, 'AT': -0.3, 'TA': -0.3}

    # Calculate base score
    score = sum(base_scores[base] for base in hexamer)

    # Add dinucleotide bonuses
    for i in range(5):
        dinucleotide = hexamer[i:i+2]
        if dinucleotide in dinucleotide_bonus:
            score += dinucleotide_bonus[dinucleotide]

    # Normalize score
    score = score / 6

    return round(score, 2)

# Example usage:
print(compute_hexamer_score('ATGCAT'))  # Output: 1.62
print(compute_hexamer_score('CGCGCG'))  # Output: 2.5
print(compute_hexamer_score('ATATAG'))  # Output: 0.95
```
