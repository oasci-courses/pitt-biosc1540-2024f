Be concise and focus on critical concepts.
For each question or subpart, your response should be between 50 and 100 words.

## Q01

**Points**: 8

Discuss how molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide unique insights into protein behavior that static structural methods cannot capture.

## Q02

**Points**: 8

In one sentence each, describe two key differences between molecular dynamics simulations and static structure determination methods.

## Q03

**Points**: 5

Explain the approximations made when applying classical mechanics principles in molecular dynamics simulations.

## Q04

**Points**: 3

Identify a scenario in biomolecular simulations where quantum mechanical effects are significant, and explain why a classical MD approach might fail to accurately model this situation.

## Q05

**Points**: 7

Briefly describe how Newton’s second law ($F = ma$) is utilized in MD simulations to simulate atomic motion.

## Q06

**Points**: 5

Explain how the potential energy landscape influences the forces experienced by atoms during a simulation. Provide an example of a protein function that could be impacted by these force calculations.

## Q07

**Points**: 3

Suppose you are simulating a protein bound to a novel small-molecule ligand.
Explain the criteria you would use to select appropriate force fields for this system. Discuss the challenges associated with parameterizing the ligand if it is not represented in standard force field libraries, and outline the steps you would take to ensure accurate simulation results.

## Q08

**Points**: 3

Dihedral angles in molecular simulations often require periodic potential functions to capture rotational flexibility. Explain why Fourier series are used to model dihedral angle potentials, and describe how adjusting the terms in a Fourier series can influence the shape of the dihedral potential energy profile.

## Q09

**Points**: 7

Discuss how adding or removing specific ions or cofactors in a simulation could alter the observed protein behavior.

## Q10

**Points**: 5

For a hypothetical protein simulation at pH 5, explain how this acidic environment could influence electrostatic interactions within the protein.

## Q11

**Points**: 5

Explain why periodic boundary conditions (PBC) are essential for simulating realistic environments. Describe what could happen to a small protein simulation if PBC were not applied.

## Q12

**Points**: 3

You are conducting a temperature-sensitive protein study. Evaluate the suitability of the Berendsen thermostat for accurately maintaining temperature. Compare it to the Nosé-Hoover thermostat, focusing on ensemble accuracy and how each method would affect the temperature distribution.

## Q13

**Points**: 5

A protein simulation shows high root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) in two specific loop regions. Discuss what this might indicate about the protein’s function and how this flexibility might impact the protein’s interactions with ligands or other biomolecules.

## Q14

**Points**: 3

Explain how the potential of mean force (PMF) is computed in molecular simulations and how it can help identify energy barriers in protein conformational changes.

## Q15

**Points**: 5

Explain how choosing a time step of 2 femtoseconds (fs) versus 0.5 fs could affect the simulation results. Discuss the potential consequences of using too large a time step on bond vibrations and overall system stability, and describe a scenario where a smaller time step would be preferable.

## Q16

**Points**: 5

Discuss the importance of ensemble averages in obtaining reliable data about system properties. Explain how the number and length of simulations with different initial conditions can impact the accuracy of ensemble averages.
