We'll explore how raw sequencing reads are transformed into meaningful measures of gene activity, navigating the complexities of multi-mapped reads and isoform variations.
The session will compare various quantification metrics, from traditional RPKM to more recent innovations like TPM, highlighting their strengths and limitations.
We'll examine cutting-edge tools for transcript-level quantification and discuss the crucial role of normalization in generating comparable expression data across samples.
Through practical examples, students will learn to interpret gene expression results, bridging the gap between computational output and biological insight.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Explain the concept of gene expression quantification in the context of RNA-seq data.
2.  Compare and contrast different methods for quantifying gene expression, such as RPKM, FPKM, and TPM.
3.  Outline the basic principles of transcript-level quantification methods (e.g., Salmon, Kallisto).
4.  Discuss the importance of normalization in RNA-seq data analysis and describe common normalization methods.
5.  Interpret basic gene expression quantification results, including understanding the meaning of expression values and their biological significance.
