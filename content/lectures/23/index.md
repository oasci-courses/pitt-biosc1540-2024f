# Lecture 23

**Date:** Nov 19, 2024

This lecture introduces students to the field of computational epigenetics, which uses computational methods to study heritable changes in gene expression that don't involve changes to the DNA sequence. We'll explore how bioinformatics and machine learning approaches are used to analyze epigenetic data, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin structure. The session will cover key concepts such as epigenome-wide association studies, prediction of regulatory elements, and integrative analysis of multi-omics data. We'll examine how computational epigenetics is advancing our understanding of development, disease, and gene regulation.
