Practical Exercises

FASTA and FASTQ File Exploration

Provide students with sample FASTA and FASTQ files
Ask them to identify key components (header, sequence, quality scores)
Have students write a simple script to count the number of sequences in each file

Running FastQC

Provide a raw sequencing dataset
Guide students through running FastQC on the command line
Have students interpret the FastQC report, identifying potential quality issues

Quality Score Analysis

Provide a FASTQ file with varying quality scores
Ask students to calculate and plot the average quality score per position
Discuss the implications of different quality score patterns


Trimming and Filtering

Introduce a dataset with known quality issues (e.g., adapter contamination, low-quality bases)
Guide students through using a trimming tool (e.g., Trimmomatic)
Have students compare FastQC reports before and after trimming


Impact of Quality Control on Assembly

Provide two datasets: one raw and one quality-controlled
Have students perform a simple assembly on both datasets using a basic assembler
Compare assembly statistics (e.g., N50, total length) between the two assemblies
Discuss the importance of quality control in genome assembly


Group Discussion: Quality Control Strategies

Divide the class into groups
Assign each group a different type of sequencing project (e.g., bacterial genome, transcriptome, metagenome)
Have groups discuss and present their proposed quality control strategy for their assigned project

These exercises will provide hands-on experience with the key concepts of the lecture, allowing students to apply their knowledge to real-world scenarios. They progress from basic file manipulation to more complex analysis and interpretation tasks, culminating in a discussion that encourages critical thinking about quality control in different contexts.
