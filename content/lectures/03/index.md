    This page is a work in progress and is subject to change at any moment.

The session introduces essential file formats used in bioinformatics and tackles the complex challenge of reconstructing complete genomes from fragmented sequencing data.
We'll walk through the key steps and concepts of reference-guided assembly, providing a comprehensive understanding of how scattered genetic pieces are woven into a coherent genomic tapestry.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Describe the structure and purpose of FASTA and FASTQ file formats in storing sequence data.
2.  Identify the challenges of assembling a genome from short sequencing reads.
3.  Distinguish between de novo assembly and reference-guided assembly approaches.
4.  Outline the basic steps involved in reference-guided genome assembly.
5.  Explain key concepts in reference assembly, including read mapping, coverage, and consensus sequence generation.
