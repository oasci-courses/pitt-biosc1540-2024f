This lecture explores differential gene expression analysis, a powerful approach for uncovering the molecular basis of biological phenomena. We'll dive into how comparing gene activity across conditions reveals crucial insights into cellular responses, development, and disease mechanisms. The session will demystify the statistical foundations of these analyses, equipping students with the tools to critically evaluate research findings. Through hands-on examples, we'll navigate the workflow of differential expression studies, from raw data to biological interpretation. We'll examine key visualizations that bring gene expression changes to life, learning to extract meaningful patterns from complex datasets. By connecting computational results to biological significance, this lecture aims to bridge the gap between bioinformatics and experimental biology, preparing students to leverage differential expression analysis in diverse research contexts.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Define differential gene expression and explain its importance in transcriptomics studies.
2.  Describe the statistical principles underlying differential expression analysis.
3.  Outline the steps in a typical differential expression analysis workflow.
4.  Explain key concepts such as fold change, p-value, and false discovery rate (FDR) in the context of differential expression.
5.  Interpret common visualizations used in differential expression analysis (e.g., volcano plots, heatmaps).
6.  Discuss the biological significance of differentially expressed genes and potential follow-up analyses.
