# Lecture 21

**Date:** Nov 7, 2024

This lecture synthesizes the key concepts and techniques explored throughout the computational structural biology module through a series of case studies. We'll examine real-world examples that showcase the application of protein structure prediction, molecular dynamics simulations, and computer-aided drug design in solving biological problems and developing therapeutics. By analyzing these cases, students will review and integrate their knowledge, gaining a holistic understanding of how computational methods complement experimental approaches in structural biology and drug discovery. The session will also highlight current challenges and future directions in the field.
