# Lecture 25

**Date:** Dec 3, 2024

This lecture introduces the fascinating field of computational neuroscience, which employs mathematical models and computer simulations to unravel the complexities of brain function. We'll explore how computational approaches bridge the gap between experimental neurobiology and theoretical understanding of neural processes. The session will cover key concepts such as neural coding, network dynamics, and learning algorithms. We'll examine active research areas including sensory processing, decision-making, and brain-machine interfaces. By the end of the lecture, students will appreciate how computational neuroscience is advancing our understanding of the brain and its potential applications in medicine and artificial intelligence.
