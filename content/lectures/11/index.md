# Lecture 11

**Date:** Oct 1, 2024

This lecture explores the powerful tools of Gene Ontology and pathway analysis, essential for extracting biological meaning from large-scale genomics data. We'll dive into how these approaches transform lists of genes into functional insights, revealing the underlying biological processes at work. The session will unpack the structured vocabulary of Gene Ontology, showing how it captures the complexity of gene function across diverse organisms. We'll examine various pathway analysis methods, comparing their strengths and applications in deciphering cellular networks. Through practical examples, students will learn to interpret enrichment results, balancing statistical significance with biological relevance. By critically examining the limitations and biases of these methods, this lecture aims to equip students with the skills to apply GO and pathway analysis judiciously, enhancing their ability to derive meaningful conclusions from genomic and transcriptomic studies.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Define Gene Ontology (GO) and explain its role in functional annotation of genes.
2.  Describe the basic structure of GO terms and their hierarchical relationships.
3.  Explain the concept of pathway analysis and its importance in interpreting transcriptomics data.
4.  Compare and contrast different approaches to pathway analysis (e.g., over-representation analysis, gene set enrichment analysis).
5.  Interpret the results of GO enrichment and pathway analysis, including understanding statistical significance and biological relevance.
6.  Discuss the limitations and potential biases in GO and pathway analysis.
