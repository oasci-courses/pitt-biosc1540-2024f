This lecture introduces the fundamental principles of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We'll explore the theoretical foundations of MD, including force fields and integration algorithms. The session will cover the basic concepts needed to understand how MD simulations provide a dynamic view of molecular systems, complementing static structural data.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Explain the basic principles and theoretical foundations of molecular dynamics simulations.
2.  Describe the components of a molecular mechanics force field.
3.  Discuss the concept of equations of motion in MD simulations.
4.  Explain the role of integration algorithms in MD simulations.
5.  Identify the limitations and challenges of classical MD simulations.
