2.  Writing simple print statements to display output.
3.  Adding inline and block comments to make code more understandable.
4.  Using Python to perform basic arithmetic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
5.  Defining and assigning variables.
6.  Recognizing and using basic Python data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
7.  Implementing decision-making logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
8.  Using lists, tuples, and dictionaries to store and manipulate grouped data.
9.  Writing reusable code by defining functions with parameters and return values.
10.  Iterating over sequences using `for` loops.
11.  Writing `while` loops to repeat actions based on conditions.
