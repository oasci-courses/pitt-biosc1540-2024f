# Lecture 19

**Date:** Nov 19, 2024

This lecture introduces students to the field of proteomics, the large-scale study of proteins in biological systems. We'll explore how proteomics complements genomics and transcriptomics to provide a more complete picture of cellular function. The session will cover key technologies used in proteomics, including mass spectrometry and protein microarrays, as well as computational methods for data analysis. We'll examine how proteomics is applied in various areas of biological research, from understanding disease mechanisms to drug discovery. By the end of the lecture, students will appreciate the power of proteomics in elucidating the complex world of proteins and its impact on our understanding of biology and medicine.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Define proteomics and explain its importance in the context of systems biology and functional genomics.
2.  Describe the basic principles of mass spectrometry and its application in protein identification and quantification.
3.  Discuss other key technologies used in proteomics research, such as protein microarrays and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.
4.  Explain the challenges in proteomics data analysis and outline basic computational approaches used to address these challenges.
5.  Identify major applications of proteomics in biological and biomedical research, including biomarker discovery and studying protein-protein interactions.
6.  Evaluate the strengths and limitations of proteomics approaches in addressing biological questions, and discuss how proteomics integrates with other 'omics' technologies.
