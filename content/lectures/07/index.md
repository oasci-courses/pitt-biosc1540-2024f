We'll explore how the transcriptome provides a dynamic snapshot of cellular activity, contrasting it with the relatively static genome.
The session will focus on RNA-seq technology, examining its principles, advantages, and experimental workflow.
We'll delve into various library preparation methods and their applications, equipping you with the knowledge to design effective transcriptomics experiments.
Finally, we'll address the unique challenges in RNA-seq data analysis, preparing you to navigate the complexities of transcriptome research.
By the end of this lecture, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of transcriptomics' power in unraveling the intricacies of gene expression and its broad applications in biological research.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Define transcriptomics and explain its relationship to genomics and gene expression studies.
2.  Compare and contrast the genome and transcriptome, highlighting the dynamic nature of the transcriptome.
3.  Explain the basic principles of RNA-seq technology and its advantages over previous transcriptomics methods.
4.  Outline the major steps in an RNA-seq experiment, from sample preparation to sequencing.
5.  Compare different RNA-seq library preparation methods (e.g., poly-A selection vs. total RNA sequencing) and their applications.
6.  Recognize the challenges specific to RNA-seq data analysis, such as handling splice junctions and multi-mapped reads.
