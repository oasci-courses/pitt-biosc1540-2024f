Building on the foundations from the previous lecture, this session focuses on the practical aspects of setting up and running MD simulations.
We'll walk through the steps involved in preparing a system for simulation, from initial structure to production run.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Explain the importance of system preparation.
2.  Describe periodic boundary conditions and their role in MD simulations.
3.  Explain the role of force field selection and topology generation.
4.  Outline the process of energy minimization and its significance.
5.  Identify and explain key parameters in MD simulations.
6.  Discuss the purpose of system relaxation.
7.  Identify key aspects for running production simulations.
