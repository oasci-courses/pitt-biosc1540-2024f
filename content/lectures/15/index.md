This final lecture in the MD series focuses on the analysis and interpretation of MD simulation data.
We'll explore common analysis techniques and how to extract meaningful biological insights from simulation trajectories.

## Learning objectives

After today, you should better understand:

1.  Molecular ensembles and their relevance.
2.  Maintaining thermodynamic equilibrium.
3.  Relaxation and production MD simulations.
4.  RMSD and RMSF as conformational changes and flexibility metricss.
5.  Relationship between probability and energy in simulations.

## Readings

Relevant content for today's lecture.

-   Any scientific literature.

Notes

- To explain the MD sampling aspect (one long vs. three short), you can use getting from one building to another.
- PMF is a little complicated to explain the meaning, probably just emphasize that it is a "kind" of energy (e.g., kinetic vs. potential).
