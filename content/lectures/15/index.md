# Lecture 15

**Date:** Oct 24, 2024

This final lecture in the MD series focuses on the analysis and interpretation of MD simulation data. We'll explore common analysis techniques and how to extract meaningful biological insights from simulation trajectories.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Describe common analysis techniques for MD trajectories, including RMSD and RMSF.
2.  Explain how to analyze protein secondary structure changes over a simulation.
3.  Discuss methods for studying protein-ligand interactions in MD simulations.
4.  Interpret MD simulation results in the context of experimental data.
5.  Identify key applications of MD simulations in studying biological systems.
6.  Critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of MD simulations in addressing biological questions.
