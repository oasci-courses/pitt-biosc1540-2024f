This lecture delves into molecular docking and virtual screening, essential techniques in computational drug discovery. We'll explore the principles behind predicting ligand-protein interactions and how these methods are used to screen large compound libraries. The session will cover different docking algorithms, scoring functions, and strategies for improving virtual screening efficiency and accuracy.

## Learning objectives

1.  Explain the basic principles of molecular docking and its role in drug discovery.
2.  Describe different types of docking algorithms and their applications.
3.  Discuss the concept of scoring functions in docking and their limitations.
4.  Outline the process of virtual screening and its advantages in drug discovery.
5.  Compare and contrast structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening approaches.
6.  Interpret and evaluate the results of docking and virtual screening experiments.
