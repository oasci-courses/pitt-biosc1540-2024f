We'll explore the challenges of aligning millions of short reads to a reference genome and discuss various algorithms and data structures that make this process efficient.
The session will focus on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) and the FM-index, two key concepts that revolutionized read alignment by enabling fast, memory-efficient sequence searching.
We'll examine how these techniques are implemented in popular alignment tools and compare their performance characteristics.
Additionally, we'll address the complexities of handling mismatches, insertions, and deletions during alignment, as well as the challenges posed by repetitive sequences in genomes.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Define read alignment and explain its importance in genomic analysis pipelines.
2.  Describe the challenges associated with aligning short reads to a large reference genome.
3.  Explain the basic principles of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) and its application in sequence alignment.
4.  Discuss the FM-index and how it enhances the efficiency of BWT-based alignments.
5.  Compare and contrast different read alignment algorithms, including hash-based and suffix tree-based approaches.
6.  Outline the steps involved in handling mismatches, insertions, and deletions during the alignment process.
