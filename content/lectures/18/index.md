!!! danger "DRAFT"

    This page is a work in progress and is subject to change at any moment.

After today, you should have a better understanding of:

1.  The basic principles of ligand-based drug design and how it differs from structure-based approaches.
2.  How QSAR models predict biological activity based on molecular structure.
3.  The role of pharmacophore modeling in identifying essential molecular features for activity.
4.  How molecular similarity and fingerprint-based methods help identify new drug candidates.
5.  The value of machine learning in predicting drug-like properties and improving ligand-based design.
6.  The applications and limitations of ligand-based drug design in drug discovery.
