This lecture provides a comprehensive examination of genomics and its transformative impact on molecular biology.
The session traces the evolution of DNA sequencing technologies, commencing with the seminal Sanger method and progressing to state-of-the-art Illumina and Nanopore platforms.
Through a comparative analysis of these technologies, we will elucidate the rapid advancements that have catalyzed genomic research.
The discourse will encompass a critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations inherent to each method, offering insights into their optimal applications in contemporary research contexts.
The lecture culminates with an in-depth overview of a typical DNA sequencing workflow, providing students with a pragmatic understanding of genomic data generation.
