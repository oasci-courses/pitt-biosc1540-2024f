The session traces the evolution of DNA sequencing technologies, commencing with the seminal Sanger method and progressing to state-of-the-art Illumina and Nanopore platforms.
Through a comparative analysis of these technologies, we will elucidate the rapid advancements that have catalyzed genomic research.
The discourse will encompass a critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations inherent to each method, offering insights into their optimal applications in contemporary research contexts.
The lecture culminates with an in-depth overview of a typical DNA sequencing workflow, providing students with a pragmatic understanding of genomic data generation.

## Learning objectives

<!-- Notes

- Add example about cluster for why we need stronger signal.
- Need to go into more detail/clarification of primers, indices, and adapters.
- There seems to be a gap in how we get from sample, to attached, amplified, and then sequenced.
- Gave example of looking out into a dark stadium and giving people flash lights.
- Students are still really struggling with how the fragments get onto the flow cell.
